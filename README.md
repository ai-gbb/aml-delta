# aml-delta

This repo will show a basic Demo of how to use Delta file format from AML Compute.

1) Use Databricks to import the notebook: DBX Delta Data Load.ipynb

  The databricks  notebook will show a demo of how to load sample safe_driver data and save it as a spark dataframe in delta file format. 
  Than we will register/create a datastore and upload the delta files and than create a file dataset referencing that datastore .
